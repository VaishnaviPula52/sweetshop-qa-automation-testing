## About This Project

This repository contains the end-to-end automation scripts for the [Sweet Shop](https://sweetshop.netlify.app) web application, built using **Playwright** and **TypeScript** as part of a structured QA learning exercise.

The full QA documentation — including the test plan, test strategy, test cases, defect log, and RTM — lives in a dedicated Google Drive folder and is linked below.

## Architecture — Page Object Model

```
Test Spec (.spec.ts)
      ↓  calls methods on
Page Object (.ts in /pages)
      ↓  interacts with
Browser / Sweet Shop App
```

Benefits: locators centralised, tests read like plain English, easy to maintain.

## CI/CD — GitHub Actions

Pipeline triggers on every PR to `main` and every push to `main`.

Steps:
1. Checkout code
2. Install Node.js 20
3. npm ci
4. Install Chromium
5. Run all tests
6. Install Java (required for Allure CLI)
7. Generate Allure report
8. Upload Allure report as artifact (kept 30 days)
9. Upload Playwright HTML report (kept 14 days)
10. Upload screenshots/videos on failure (kept 7 days)
